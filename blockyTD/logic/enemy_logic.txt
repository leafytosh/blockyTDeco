ENEMY LOGIC — blockyTD
======================

Goal:
Define how enemies move, take damage, and interact with towers and shrine.


1. Movement
-----------

- Enemies follow a fixed path defined by the current map.
- Each enemy type has:
  - Speed
  - Health
  - Size (optional visual concept)
  - Special traits (if any)

- Movement rules:
  - Enemies always move forward along the path.
  - Enemies cannot leave the path.
  - If they reach the shrine/end point, they deal shrine/life damage.


2. Health and damage
--------------------

- Each enemy has:
  - Max HP
  - Current HP

- When hit by a projectile:
  - Current HP is reduced by the projectile’s damage.
  - If HP <= 0:
    - Enemy dies.
    - Triggers on-death effects (currency, emotes, etc.).


3. Emote behavior
-----------------

- O_O on spawn:
  - Enemy has just entered the map.

- >_< when hit:
  - Used briefly when taking damage.

- T_T at low HP:
  - Below a HP threshold (e.g. 20–30%), enemy looks weakened.

- + :( on death:
  - Used at the moment of defeat.

- ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡° ) during shrine activation:
  - When shrine is active, some enemies show this corrupted/hungry look,
    especially shrine-breakers or special units.


4. Enemy types (examples)
-------------------------

- Conehead:
  - Fast movement.
  - Low-medium HP.
  - Threat: reaches shrine quickly if ignored.

- Blob:
  - Slow movement (-- -- emote).
  - High HP.
  - Threat: tanks damage, protects other enemies behind.

- Shrine Breaker:
  - Ignores most tower aggro (conceptually).
  - Targets shrine behavior:
    - Could reduce shrine charge.
    - Could interfere with shrine activation.
  - Emotes:
    - ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡° ) when near shrine or during shrine events.


5. Interactions with shrine
---------------------------

- When shrine activates:
  - Some enemies get:
    - Buffs (corruption).
    - Visual change: ( ͡° ʖ̯ ͡° ) or other marks.
  - Others may become weaker (if shrine is defensive).

- When shrine fades:
  - Buffs are removed.
  - Enemies return to their base stats/emotes.


6. Reactions to player chat
---------------------------

- If player types >_<:
  - Nearby enemies may briefly flinch:
    - Small slow effect for a moment.

- If player types >o< (optional later):
  - Enemies could scatter or slightly desync movement pattern.

These effects are conceptual and can be tuned or removed later.
