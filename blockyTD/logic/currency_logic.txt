CURRENCY LOGIC — blockyTD
=========================

Goal:
Define how players earn and spend currency in blockyTD.


1. Earning currency
-------------------

- Main source: killing enemies.
  - Each enemy type rewards a certain amount.
  - Stronger enemies give more.

- Possible bonuses:
  - Wave completion reward.
  - Shrine events granting bonus currency.
  - Streaks: multiple waves survived without shrine damage.


2. Spending currency
--------------------

- Placing towers:
  - Each tower type has a base cost.
  - Cost may increase slightly as more of the same tower is built.

- Upgrading towers:
  - Upgrades cost more than placement.
  - Higher upgrade levels cost increasingly more.

- Shrine offerings (optional):
  - Player can spend currency to:
    - Recharge shrine.
    - Extend shrine Active phase.
    - Unlock shrine-linked tower effects.


3. Scaling and balance
----------------------

- As waves progress:
  - Enemy rewards increase to match difficulty.
  - Tower and upgrade costs scale, but not to the point of feeling unfair.

- The goal:
  - Player should feel slightly pressured, but not starved.


4. Chat and currency (optional hooks)
-------------------------------------

- Certain chat commands or emote patterns could:
  - Trigger small currency bonuses (rare or cosmetic).
  - Be used as rewards for secrets or Tartar events.

These are optional and can be added later if they fit the vibe.
