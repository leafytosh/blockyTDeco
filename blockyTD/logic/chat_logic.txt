CHAT LOGIC — blockyTD
=====================

Goal:
Define how in-game chat works and how it interacts with systems.


1. Who can chat
---------------

- Only active game users (players in the match) can send chat.
- Spectators (if they exist) have no gameplay-impacting chat.
- System messages are separate and cannot be faked by players.


2. Types of messages
--------------------

- Regular text:
  - Purely social, no gameplay effect.

- Emote messages:
  - ASCII faces like ^_^, >_<, ÷w<, etc.
  - Can trigger reactions in towers, enemies, and shrine.

- Commands:
  - Start with / (slash).
  - Example commands:
    - /emote <face>
    - /shrinemode
    - /tartar


3. Emote handling
-----------------

- When a player types an emote:
  - It can appear visually above their avatar or towers (design choice).
  - It may trigger a small gameplay effect if defined in emote_triggers.

- Examples:
  - >_< : enemies flinch slightly.
  - ^_^ : towers get tiny morale boost.
  - >:) : small increase in shrine charge.


4. Commands and effects
-----------------------

- /emote <face>:
  - Explicit emote display.
  - Used to guarantee recognition by the system.

- /shrinemode:
  - Signals desire to awaken shrine.
  - Could:
    - Add a bit of shrine charge.
    - Trigger Awakening when threshold is already close.

- /tartar:
  - Secret or special event trigger.
  - Could:
    - Spawn special visual.
    - Cause unique emote chain.
    - Influence lore elements.


5. Limitations and fairness
---------------------------

- Chat effects should:
  - Be small and fun, not mandatory or overpowered.
  - Never replace core gameplay like good tower placement.

- If multiple players spam emotes:
  - Effects can be capped or rate-limited to avoid abuse.
