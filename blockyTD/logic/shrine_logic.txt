SHRINE LOGIC — blockyTD
=======================

Goal:
Define how the shrine behaves, its states, and its influence.


1. Shrine states
----------------

- Dormant:
  - No active effects.
  - Towers behave normally.
  - Enemies behave normally.

- Awakening:
  - Visual/audio feedback (conceptual).
  - Emotes: O_O for shrine-linked elements.
  - Short delay before becoming Active.

- Active:
  - Towers receive buffs.
  - Enemies may gain corruption or special traits.
  - Strongest influence phase.

- Fading:
  - Buffs gradually weaken.
  - Emotes: T_T on towers, or mixed states.
  - Returns to Dormant at the end.


2. Activation rules
-------------------

- Shrine can activate:
  - Automatically at milestone waves.
  - When shrine charge reaches a threshold.
  - Via special player chat (e.g. /shrinemode) if allowed by design.

- Shrine charge:
  - Increases from:
    - Killing enemies.
    - Surviving waves.
    - Possibly player chat/emotes (optional).


3. Effects on towers
--------------------

- During Active state:
  - Towers in shrine radius:
    - Gain increased damage or fire rate.
    - Might gain special visual indication (÷w< emote).

- Shrine-linked towers:
  - May unlock unique behaviors only when shrine is Active.


4. Effects on enemies
---------------------

- During Active state:
  - Some enemies may:
    - Become weaker near shrine.
    - Or become stronger if shrine is “corrupted” design-wise.

- Shrine breaker enemies:
  - Interact directly with shrine:
    - Reduce charge.
    - Shorten Active duration.
    - Delay next activation.


5. Interaction with chat
------------------------

- Chat commands:
  - /shrinemode:
    - May help push shrine toward Awakening.
  - Specific emotes (e.g. ÷w<, >:) ) could:
    - Slightly affect shrine charge or state.

This keeps shrine feeling connected to both gameplay and player expression.
