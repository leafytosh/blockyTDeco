WAVE LOGIC — blockyTD
=====================

Goal:
Define how waves are structured, spawned, and scaled over time.


1. Wave structure
-----------------

- Each wave:
  - Has a wave number (1, 2, 3, ...).
  - Contains a list of enemy types and counts.
  - May have special rules (e.g. shrine event on wave 5).

- Basic pattern:
  - Early waves: few enemies, mostly simple types.
  - Mid waves: mixed enemy types, faster pacing.
  - Later waves: stronger enemies, shrine interactions, more pressure.


2. Spawning behavior
--------------------

- Waves start after:
  - A short countdown.
  - Player input (e.g., "start wave" button) if desired.

- Enemies spawn:
  - From a fixed entry point.
  - With a delay between spawns (spawn interval).
  - Possibly in small groups.


3. Difficulty scaling
---------------------

- As wave number increases:
  - Enemy HP increases.
  - Enemy speed may slightly increase.
  - Enemy count per wave increases.
  - Composition changes (more shrine breakers, more tanky units).

- Currency rewards:
  - Increase with wave number.
  - Stay balanced with tower costs and upgrades.


4. Shrine milestones
--------------------

- At specific waves (e.g., 5, 10, 15...):
  - Shrine events occur:
    - Awakening
    - Active phase
    - Fading

- During shrine waves:
  - Towers are buffed.
  - Enemies may get altered behaviors.
  - Player chat can have stronger effects.


5. Between-wave logic
---------------------

- Between waves, player can:
  - Place new towers.
  - Upgrade existing towers.
  - Plan for shrine events.
  - Use chat in preparation (if design allows).

This is the pacing layer that ties towers and enemies together.
