ASCII EMOTES USED IN blockyTD
=============================

Emotes are the emotional language of blockyTD. 
They appear on towers, enemies, UI elements, shrine events, and chat commands.
Players can type emotes in chat to trigger reactions in the world.

Each emote has:
- a meaning
- a trigger
- a usage category (tower, enemy, shrine, chat, UI)
- optional player‑chat effects

PLAYER CHAT EMOTE SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------

Only active game users (players currently in a blockyTD session) can chat.

Players can type:
- /emote <face>
- or simply type the ASCII face directly

Chat emotes can:
- trigger tower mood changes
- cause enemies to react
- influence shrine charge
- create small visual FX
- unlock hidden Tartar lore events

Examples:
- Typing >_< makes nearby enemies flinch
- Typing ^_^ boosts tower morale
- Typing >:) increases shrine charge
- Typing ÷w< may awaken the shrine early

NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------

Emotes must remain readable at small sizes.
Emotes should never overlap gameplay-critical UI.
Emotes are part of blockyTD’s identity and should be used generously.
