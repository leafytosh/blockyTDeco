blockyTD is a cozy‑chaos tower defense game built around retro charm, ASCII emotions, and modular design. The world is intentionally simple: blocky maps, expressive enemies, and towers with personality. The game’s identity comes from its handmade aesthetic, shrine rituals, and the presence of Tartar, the silent guardian cat. Core themes: - Minimalism with soul - Retro ASCII expression - Cozy chaos instead of violence - Systems that feel alive - Player-driven rituals and discovery blockyTD is not about realism. It’s about clarity, charm, and emotional feedback through ASCII faces.
